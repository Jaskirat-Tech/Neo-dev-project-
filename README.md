FoodLink
FoodLink is a community‑driven platform designed to reduce food waste and fight hunger by connecting people or businesses with extra food to local shelters, food banks, and individuals in need.
The project supports Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and aims to make food sharing simple, fast, and accessible.

Overview
Every day, large amounts of edible food are thrown away while many people struggle to access meals.
FoodLink addresses this issue by providing a simple website where:

Donors (restaurants, stores, households) can share available extra food

Receivers (shelters or individuals) can find and claim food

Communities can reduce waste and support people in need
